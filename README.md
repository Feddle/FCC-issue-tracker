Project Issue Tracker

1) SET NODE_ENV to `test` without quotes and set DB to your mongo connection string in .env file
2) Complete the project in `routes/api.js` or by creating a handler/controller
3) You will add any security features to `server.js`
4) You will create all of the functional tests in `tests/2_functional-tests.js`

NOTE: The functional tests should've been done more thoroughly. It's really not enough to test a PUT request by the response of the         API, the actual database entry should also be checked for correctness. There was some confusion about adding my own tests alongside the boilerplate ones so I'll leave this be for now (also this came to me as a shower thought few days after I had posted my answer). - Feddle
